STAT 545A Troubleshooting Exercise for Milestone 1
================

There are **3 code chunks with errors** in this Rmd. Your objective is
to fix all of the errors in this worksheet. Make sure to indicate what
lines you changed and why (by commenting \# in the code).

For the purpose of grading, each erroneous code chunk is equally
weighted.

## Welcome to R and Rmd!

This document is written in **R Markdown**. We’ll use this document to
explore the `mtcars` dataset.

First, let’s store the current date as a variable. We can use the
function `Sys.Date` with no arguments to get the current date:

``` r
## ERROR 1 ##
today <- Sys.Date() # changed line 18, removed the underscores for the "today" variable
```

You may notice that, although an error might appear in these cells, this
Rmd file knits just fine. That’s because the `error = TRUE` *chunk
option* is included in each chunk, allowing the Rmd file to knit, even
when an error is encountered.

Now, let’s load the `tidyverse` (meta-) package:

``` r
## ERROR 2 ##
library(tidyverse) # changed "libraries" to "library"
```

    ## ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──
    ## ✔ dplyr     1.1.3     ✔ readr     2.1.4
    ## ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.0
    ## ✔ ggplot2   3.4.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1
    ## ✔ lubridate 1.9.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.0
    ## ✔ purrr     1.0.2     
    ## ── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
    ## ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
    ## ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
    ## ℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors

By loading the tidyverse, a function called `glimpse` has been made
available. This function is useful for viewing a data set. Let’s take a
look at the `mtcars` dataset by applying the `glimpse` function to
`mtcars`!

``` r
## ERROR 3 ##
glimpse mtcars
```

    ## Error: <text>:2:9: unexpected symbol
    ## 1: ## ERROR 3 ##
    ## 2: glimpse mtcars
    ##            ^

Thanks to Icíar Fernández Boyano for coming up with most of this
worksheet.
