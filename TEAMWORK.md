## Timing:
We are doing the project together in real time in one sitting, so we are communicating and debugging issues as they arise. We are not leaving this to the last minute, and we are leaving ample time to fix any issues and make sure we are contributing an equal amount to the project.


## Communication:
1. Slack for general communication and planning meetings
2. Zoom for working on the project
3. Issues on Github to introduce ourselves.
