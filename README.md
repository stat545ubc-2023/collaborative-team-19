# README.md

## What is this project about? :thinking:
This project is an exercise in getting familiar with GitHub and Rstudio, collaborating with other students, and practicing creating pull requests (in a new branch) and merging them (to the main branch).  

This project was created by @AdeshBaral1 @almita @Apsara421 and @christine747 :sparkles:.
